/**
Problem - H-Index II

Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example -
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
**/

/** Solution-

The below solution uses binary search to find the paper with citation ci such that number of papers with atleast ci citations are greater than ci.
Thus, ci is the h-index value. As the papers are in ascending order of citations, BS can be applied.
Runtime - O(logn)
